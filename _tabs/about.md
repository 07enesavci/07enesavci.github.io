# About

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about **Penetration Testing**, **Web Application Security**, and **OSINT**. My curiosity occasionally drags me into a bit of **Reverse Engineering**, but my real drive comes from probing, breaking, and understanding systems inside out.  
I actively compete in **CTFs**, because solving complex challenges not only sharpens my skills but also keeps the fun alive. Platforms like **Hackviser**, **TryHackMe**, and **HackTheBox** are my training grounds, where I explore new attack vectors and test unconventional techniques.  
At my university, I’m part of the **Network and Cybersecurity Club**, where we organize activities, share knowledge, and push each other to learn by doing. Collaborating with like-minded peers fuels my motivation to keep exploring the offensive side of security.  
When I’m not deep into payloads, exploits, or OSINT trails, you’ll probably find me analyzing logs, experimenting with Linux, or planning the next CTF sprint. Breaking things on purpose—and then fixing them—is my way of learning.
